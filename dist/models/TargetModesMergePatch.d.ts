/**
 * @type TargetModesMergePatch
 * Choose how the scopes's output should be formatted for this target. The following **modes** are available:
 *
 * **`aggregated`**
 *   * This option will produce one row per geographical area.
 *   * This option is best for geo-targeted ad campaigns.
 *
 * **`hashed`**
 *   * Faraday's name, physical address, and email is emitted in hashed form. Data is randomly ordered to prevent re-identification. All payload columns are emitted except raw propensity scores and attributes.
 *   * This option facilitates digital acquisition use cases.
 *
 * **`identified`**
 *   * All identifiable information specified by `identity_sets` in source data is emitted in cleartext - see <a href="https://faraday.ai/developers/reference/createdataset">/datasets</a> for more detail. All payload columns are emitted. Your account may have a limit on how many rows can be returned.
 *   * This option is best for direct mail and canvassing campaigns.
 *
 * **`referenced`**
 *   * This option will produce one row per person based on the identifier column of a dataset of your choice. To protect privacy, this will not include identifying information other than the key you select.
 *   * This option is best for merging data back into your stack.
