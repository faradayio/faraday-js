 * The strategy to use for bias mitigation.

 * Currently supported:
 *   - `none` - ignore bias
 *   - `equality` - neutralize bias
 *   - `equity` - invert bias
 *
 * Bias mitigation will attempt to match the baseline population rate for the dimension of concern (DOC) (`equality`) or overcorrect for past inequality in the direction of the underprivileged DOC (`equity`).
