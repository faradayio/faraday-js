 * The strategy to be applied to gender and/or age to mitigate or reverse the bias found in the attainment population.
 *
 * Though the spec appears you can combine different mitigation strategies per dimension of concern (age=equity, gender=equality), API runtime validation will prevent it for now. Later we may support this so the spec is designed for future proofing. Note: age=none, gender=equity is allowed.
